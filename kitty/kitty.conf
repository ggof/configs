#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 22.0
#: Font size (in pts)

#: Cursor customization {{{

cursor #cccccc

#: Default cursor color

cursor_text_color #111111

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background

cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: Defines the thickness of the beam cursor (in pts)

cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: Defines the thickness of the underline cursor (in pts)

cursor_blink_interval -1

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that numbers smaller than repaint_delay will be limited to
#: repaint_delay.

cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity.  Set to zero to never stop blinking.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position.

scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
#: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
#: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
#: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
#: implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively 10000
#: lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII text,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB.

wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
#: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
#: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
#: numbers to change scroll direction.

touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by a touchpad. Note this is only used
#: for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS and
#: Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction.

#: }}}

editor nvim

#: The console editor to use when editing the kitty config file or
#: similar tasks. A value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. Note that this environment
#: variable has to be set not just in your shell startup scripts but
#: system-wide, otherwise kitty will not see it.

linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice.
